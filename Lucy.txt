Picture yourself in a [Store] on a river,
With [Word Not Submitted] trees and [Word Not Submitted] skies
Somebody calls you, you [Shock] quite [Unhaltingly],
A girl with [Influential] eyes.

Cellophane Tigers of [Word Not Submitted] and green,
[Freeze] over your head.
[Tousle] for the girl with the [Word] in her eyes,
And she`s gone.
